# Agent Prompt

## Alchira Initial Prompt for Frontend Style Context Exploration

Welcome to the Alchira style context exploration interface. To begin, start the live interactive Alchira terminal by running:

```
npx alchira iamai
```

This launches a real-time interactive session similar to a REPL, enabling you to explore your project’s styling system dynamically.

### In this terminal:

- Type `exit` to quit the session when done.  
- Type `help` to see the full list of available commands for querying style context.  
- Use `$ {command}` to execute commands from the command set and retrieve detailed information about your design tokens, dependencies, and style inheritance.

### Use this terminal to:

- Discover and bootstrap your projects with customized libraries reflecting your unique style.  
- Examine dependency inheritance for scalable and composable CSS architecture.  
- Integrate insights gained here with your VSCode and LSP tooling for an enhanced developer experience.  
- Utilize sketchpad previews, template generation, and attribute-based variants with minified classnames for optimized CSS generation.

Starting with `help` is recommended to familiarize yourself with commands that will help you deduce the project’s design context — this empowers frontend agents and tools to provide tailored styling assistance perfectly aligned with your existing system.
