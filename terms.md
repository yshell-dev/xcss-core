> XCSS—Write it, get it, no deps—built for lazy devs by a lazy dev.

## 1. Scope and Relationship to License
- These T&C cover your use of the XCSS platform (e.g., website, console, credit purchases), while the License governs the XCSS software tool usage (e.g., "xcss preview," "xcss build").
- In case of conflict, the License prevails for software-specific terms.

## 2. Account and Access
- **Eligibility:** You must be 18+ or have legal authority to use XCSS services.
- **Registration:** Proprietary Features (e.g., "xcss build") require a Project ID and Access Key, obtained via the XPKTR Labs console at xcss.xpktr.com after the preview period (ends April 3, 2025).
- **Responsibility:** You are responsible for securing your Project ID and Access Key—do not share them.

## 3. Credits and Payment
- **Purchase:** Credits are required for Proprietary Features and purchased through xcss.xpktr.com
  - $2 per Credit
  - Bundled rates: 10 Credits for $15 (see pricing page for details)
- **Usage:** Each "xcss build" command consumes Credits as outlined in the License and pricing documentation.
- **No Refunds:** Credits are non-refundable, except where required by applicable law (e.g., consumer protection rights).
- **Expiration:** Credits expire 12 months from purchase unless otherwise stated.
- **Adjustments:** We may adjust Credit pricing or bundles with 30 days’ notice via xcss.xpktr.com—existing Credits remain valid at their purchase rate.
- **Payment Terms:** Payments are processed securely—no chargebacks allowed unless fraud is proven.

## 4. User Conduct
- **Permitted Use:** Use XCSS for development as intended—integrate, build, showcase.
- **Prohibited Actions:** Do not misuse XCSS (e.g., bypass credit system, spam commands, overload servers) or violate License restrictions (e.g., reverse-engineering, redistributing Proprietary Features).
- **Respect:** Honor confidentiality and intellectual property terms in the License.

## 5. Tools Powered by XCSS
- **Development:** Building tools or applications powered by XCSS for public or commercial use requires a written contract with Us—contact licensing@xpktr.com.
- **Terms:** Contracts will specify usage rights and profit-sharing (e.g., a percentage of profits derived from such tools shared with XPKTR Labs).

## 6. Service and Support
- **Availability:** We aim for 95% uptime of xcss.xpktr.com and the Labs console—downtime may occur for maintenance (announced via website).
- **Preview Support:** During the preview period (March 21-April 3, 2025), support is via community channels (e.g., github.com/yshell-dev/xcss-online issues).
- **Post-Preview Support:** Email xcss@xpktr.com for paid users—response within 2 business days.
- **Linter Compatibility:** Post-preview, We may enhance XCSS to work with standard CSS linters (e.g., Stylelint)—updates at Our discretion.

## 7. Privacy and Data
- **Data Collection:** We collect usage metrics for Proprietary Features (e.g., command frequency, feature patterns) to improve XCSS—see License Section 13 and Privacy Policy at xcss.xpktr.com/privacy.
- **No PII:** We do not collect personally identifiable information unless You provide it (e.g., email for support).
