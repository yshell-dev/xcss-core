## End User License Agreement (EULA)

## 1. Introduction

This End User License Agreement ("EULA") governs your use of the Package ("Package"), which is provided under the MIT License. By installing or using the Package, you agree to comply with all terms outlined in this agreement.

When redistributing the Package, you must include this EULA and the full text of the MIT License unchanged in all copies or substantial portions of the Package.

## 2. License for XCSS Package

The Package itself, including all associated source code and assets outside the embedded `./source` folder, is licensed under the MIT License. This permits free use, modification, distribution, and private or commercial use under the terms of the MIT License.

## 3. Embedded `./source` Folder

The Package includes an embedded folder called `./source` which contains a source executable. This folder is distributed under its own documentation, privacy, licensing, and terms specific to its contents.

### 3.1 Alternate Documentation

The `./source` folder includes its own documentation files which supersede the Package's main documentation for any components or scripts contained therein. Users should refer to those documents for usage, build instructions, and contribution guidelines specific to the npm package.

### 3.2 Licensing of `./source`

The `./source` folder may be subject to a different license than the MIT License applied to the core Package. It is your responsibility to review and comply with the license terms provided within the `./source` folder before using, modifying, or distributing its contents.

## 4. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Package and the contents of the `./source` folder are provided "as is" without any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

The authors or copyright holders shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the Package or the `./source` folder contents, including direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.

<!-- You may add additional terms after this comment in case of redistribution, without contradicting all the above terms -->
